Your website should be built using any combination of html, CSS, PHP, or Javascript.  We are expecting it to run on our local webserver without a database or CMS backing.  Please include a readme with any notes about running your work.  Your work will be assessed based on attention to detail and overall functionality. Bonus points will be awarded for any additional creativity and innovation as well as well readable code.
# Descriptiom
This project is a webpage that fufills the requirements of the test as well as bonus work. The project uses CSS grids as the layout and the color scheme outlined by the DNC. The only button that is linked to an actual webpage is the volunteer button. The technologies used are semantic HTML and CSS.
# Considerations
I did have some issues with electricy over the weekend and was fixed today. This was the first time this happened to me, where I lost power in most areas and outlet power. This did hinder some areas I would like to fix like responsiveness and additional accessibility elements.
